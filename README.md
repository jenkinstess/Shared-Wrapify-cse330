# Shared Wrapify

Final project for CSE330 Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming at WashU. 

Shared Wrapify gives a user their top 5 artists, genres, and tracks, and allows them the option to compare their information to other users that have accessed the site. It also shows the user the last saved track in their library and if the user is playing a song, will display the title and cover art for that song. 

This was developed by Tess Jenkins and Jamie Xu.
